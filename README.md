This is a javacript script that listens to new blocks and will send your pulsechain coins from your compromised wallet to a new wallet that you specify.

The only groups that currently exist for helping people with compromised wallets for pulsechain help whales only. So I had to come up with a script on my own to save my pulsechain coins once mainnet is live. And I am willing to make this script available to others as well. To deter other scumbag hackers from obtaining this script I am charging a small price, but it is something anyone can afford. Please email me at pulsedmane@gmail.com if you are interested.
