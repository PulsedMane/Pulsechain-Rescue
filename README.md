This is a javacript script that listens to new blocks and will send your pulsechain coins from your compromised wallet to a new wallet that you specify. gwei can be adjusted in the code. The included instructions will explain how.

The only groups that currently exist for helping people with compromised wallets for pulsechain help whales only. So I had to come up with a script on my own to save my pulsechain coins once mainnet is live. And I am willing to make this script available to others as well. To deter other scumbag hackers from obtaining this script I am charging a small fee, but it is something anyone can afford. You can email me at pulsedmane@gmail.com if you are interested.
